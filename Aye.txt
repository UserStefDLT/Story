Aye {for the party}
My name is Aye, like in “Aye Aye Captain!”
I grew up on a ship. My mom was the captain. I used to help a little by passing messages from my mom to the crew. They used to tell me “Aye Aye Lil Cap!”

One day when I was 12 an eldritch storm took a toll on the ship, the navigator suggested a location which was a risk, but the ship wouldn’t have made it to another location. Captain Mom(not her real name) left with some of the crew to get the repairs and supplies needed, but I never saw her again... 
A few days later some guards came to seize the ship and said that it was a pirate ship. I was taken to a monastery because I was not old enough to go to prison and they thought I was being groomed to be a pirate. I didn't enjoy the monastery much, so I sneaked out alot and broke into a library to find information about my mother.

I made some friends who were also good at sneaking around, and some “more than friends”, but that is another story for another day. With the help of my friends I learned to keep the lights out, and while I was not able to read in the dark, one of my "friends" was. Safe to say, I found some interesting books, but one day the "friend" who used to help me disappear and I couldn't continue researching.

One book that I kept was of this Star far far away. One part of the book talked about wishing on a star. What a whimsical idea, wishing to the lights on the sky for knowledge or a miracle. Without anything to lose I made a wish... Funny thing about stars… did you know that they can talk back?

After a while my Star gave me the ability to see in the dark, I call it Star's Sight, which is what allows me to continue researching. It has been 5 years since the storm that changed my life. I hope I can find what happened to my mother one day, but until then I will try to prepare myself for whatever obstacle I can find.
